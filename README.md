# Implement Devise using BDD

This repo consists of a series of commits which implement the [Devise Gem](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) using Behavior Driven Development.

The starting point for this module is the code created in the [Rails Getting Started](https://github.com/software-academy/rails_getting_started_bdd) repo.
